        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening and closing tag.</li>
          <li>The head element contains site metadata unseen by visitors.</li>
          <li>The body element contains visible content.</li>
          <li>The link element connects external resources to the document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines data such as character set, description, keywords, author and viewport.</li>
          <li>Common element types: text, image, header, list.</li>
          <li>Elements that divide and describe: meta-related, content division, semantic.</li>
          <li>Nested means code within code.</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside other elements are considered Child Elements.</li>
          <li>Element that holds the Child Elements is the Parent Element.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS styles an element directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is less flexible because each inline stlye must be edited individually.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet adds entire sheet to HTML file using a style element.</li>
          <li>When using an Internal Style Sheet, rules only apply to that page.</li>
          <li>External Style Sheets allow developers to keep all CSS rules in a separate file.</li>
          <li>Use a link element to link an external style sheet.</li>
          <li>Margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines an element or attribute to which the rules or declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>CSS Box Model includes margins outside the element, element borders, padding and content.</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule, promoting DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself coding).</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks which branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds all modifications in current working branch to staging area.</li>
          <li>git commit -m: creates a commit that captures current staged changes and includes a message.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls current/updated main branch data. DO THIS OFTEN.</li>
          <li>git push origin *branch name*: pushes local changes to remote branch and signals a pull request on GitHub.</li>
          <li>Key to writing effective commit messages is to write them as imperative commands in the present tense.</li>
          <li>A feature branch might be working on a single feature already incorporated into working version.</li>
          <li>A develop branch might be developing features that haven't been incorporated into working version yet.</li>
          <li>Base branch: branch we're merging into. Comparison branch: branch that needs merging.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich.</li>
          <li>We use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed or if it's executed at all.</li>
          <li>Arrays are used to store data types.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. Can deviate from flow if conditions are met.</li>
          <li>You can add more than one condition by using else if.</li>
          <li>Falsy: values like 0, "", null or Boolean - false.</li>
          <li>Truthy: all other values including Boolean - true.</li>
          <li>Strict Equality Operator: === checks to see if two values are equal. Returns true if values are equal, false if not.</li>
          <li>If statements introduce decision-making into our code. Code will execute only if the statement meets a condition or if it's true.</li>
