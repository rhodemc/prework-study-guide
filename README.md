# prework-study-guide
A study guide for UO Coding Bootcamp pre-work.

# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was motivated to create the Prework Study Guide Webpage because it will be a useful reference guide, not only during Bootcamp, but throughout my career.

I built the project because I wanted a singular space to collect all of my notes, instead of having them in various locations.

Having a singular site for my notes creates ease of use and quick reference, solving potential organizational issues.

Shown on the completed webpage, I learned basic coding vocabulary and basic form and function of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript code.
